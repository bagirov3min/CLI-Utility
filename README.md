# CLI Utility

Welcome to My CLI Utility Project!

[English](README.md) | [Русский](README-ru.md)

## Description

This application provides user authentication (registration 
and authorization) capabilities through the command-line 
interface (CLI). Users can set their name, email, and password, 
and also have the option to generate a password automatically. 
Upon successful authorization, users gain access to commands for 
adding records to the storage (any text entered through the 
keyboard). When exiting the program (either through a command 
or by closing the window), registration data is saved. However, 
for the next login, users need to authenticate again.

Data Storage: SQLite database.

## Usage

The program can be employed to implement user authentication and 
authorization services via the command-line interface (CLI). The 
program uses password hashing with the sha256 algorithm to ensure
the secure storage of passwords.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
   https://github.com/bagirov3min/CLI-Utility`
